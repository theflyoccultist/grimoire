    Mini-Quest: Doom Bot Awakens

    Build a simple Python client AI that:

        Connects to your Doom server over TCP.

        After greeting, randomly decides every few seconds:

            Move forward

            Move backward

            Turn left

            Turn right

            "Shoot"

        After 10 random moves, disconnects politely.

    Bonus XP:

        Log actions (so you can see the botâ€™s choices).

        Randomly simulate a "panic state" (sends many move commands at once).

Victory Condition:
If you see the server log showing a flurry of random actions from your bot without crashes or weird behavior?
Quest complete. Level up unlocked.
