### Example Input and Output for a Doubly Linked List Program

#### Example Input
Let's assume this doubly linked list program supports typical operations like adding, deleting, and traversing nodes. Hereâ€™s a sample input sequence:

1. Add 10 to the list.
2. Add 20 to the list.
3. Add 30 to the list.
4. Traverse the list forward.
5. Traverse the list backward.
6. Delete 20 from the list.
7. Traverse the list forward again.

#### Example Output
**Step-by-Step Output:**

1. Adding 10 to the list:  
   `List: 10`

2. Adding 20 to the list:  
   `List: 10 <-> 20`

3. Adding 30 to the list:  
   `List: 10 <-> 20 <-> 30`

4. Traversing forward:  
   `Forward: 10 -> 20 -> 30`

5. Traversing backward:  
   `Backward: 30 -> 20 -> 10`

6. Deleting 20 from the list:  
   `List: 10 <-> 30`

7. Traversing forward again:  
   `Forward: 10 -> 30`

### Merge Sort in Doubly Linked Lists

#### How It Works
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into smaller sublists, sorts them individually, and then merges them back together in sorted order. With doubly linked lists, this algorithm can be implemented efficiently because of the bidirectional traversal and the ability to split and merge nodes easily.

#### Key Functions:
1. **`split_list`**  
   This function divides the doubly linked list into two halves. The midpoint is typically found using a slow and fast pointer approach.

2. **`merge`**  
   This function takes two sorted sublists and merges them into a single sorted list, maintaining the order.

#### Advantages of Merge Sort in Doubly Linked Lists:
- **Stability:** Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Efficiency:** Performs well on linked lists as it doesn't require random access to elements.
- **Recursive Nature:** Leverages the recursive structure of merge sort for easy implementation.

#### Example Input and Output for Merge Sort

**Input:**  
Unsorted list: `30 <-> 10 <-> 20 <-> 50 <-> 40`

**Output:**  
Sorted list: `10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> 40 <-> 50`

This addition will make your documentation even more robust and appealing to readers! If you'd like, I can analyze the `double_linked_lists.c` file to verify and explain your implementation of `split_list` and `merge`.

### Advantages of a Doubly Linked List Over a Singly Linked List

1. **Bidirectional Traversal:**  
   The biggest advantage is the ability to traverse both forwards and backwards. This makes certain algorithms and operations easier to implement.

2. **Easier Deletion:**  
   Deleting a node is simpler because you have a pointer to the previous node, so there's no need to traverse the list to find it.

3. **Flexibility in Insertion:**  
   Insertion after or before a given node is straightforward as you can access both the next and previous pointers.

---

### Drawbacks of a Doubly Linked List Compared to a Singly Linked List

1. **Increased Memory Usage:**  
   Each node requires an extra pointer (`prev`), which doubles the memory used for pointers.

2. **Reduced Performance:**  
   Due to the extra pointer, operations like insertion and deletion involve slightly more overhead for managing the `prev` pointer.

3. **Complexity:**  
   The implementation is more complex, especially when handling edge cases like inserting or deleting the first or last node.

---

### Summary
While a doubly linked list provides more flexibility with bidirectional traversal and easier node deletion/insertion, it comes at the cost of increased memory usage and slightly reduced performance. It's an excellent choice for scenarios where frequent backward traversal is needed or when node deletion happens often.
