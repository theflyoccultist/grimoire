## ncurses Routines in Rapid Succession

---

### Chapter 13: `chgat`, `mvchgat`, `wchgat`, `mvwchgat`

`chgat` style functions modify the attributes of a sequence of characters already printed on the screen, without reprinting them.

- Fast and visually smooth for highlighting and toggling styles without redrawing full lines.

Common Signature:
```c
chgat(int n, attr_t attr, short color_pair, const void *opts);
```

- `n`: Number of characters to affect. Use `-1` to go to end of line.
- `attr`: Attribute flags like `A_BOLD`, `A_REVERSE`, etc.
- `color_pair`: The index of the color pair (from init_pair).
- `opts`: Always `NULL`. Reserved for future cursed extensions.

The Family Tree:

| Function     | Context       | Cursor Affects? | Uses a `WINDOW`? | Coordinates? |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `chgat()`    | stdscr        | Yes             | No               | Current pos  |
| `mvchgat()`  | stdscr        | Yes             | No               | Moves cursor |
| `wchgat()`   | custom window | Yes             | Yes              | Current pos  |
| `mvwchgat()` | custom window | Yes             | Yes              | Moves cursor |

ðŸ’¡ Practical Differences
ðŸ§¼ chgat()
  - Applies to the default window (stdscr)
  - Starts at the current cursor position
  - Doesnâ€™t move the cursor, just modifies stuff starting from it

ðŸš¶ mvchgat(y, x, ...)
  - Moves the cursor to (y, x) on stdscr
  - Then applies the attribute change from there
  - Returns the cursor to the position after the change

ðŸªŸ wchgat(win, ...)
  - Applies to a specific WINDOW
  - Uses the window's cursor position
  - Use this when youâ€™ve made custom windows (menus, popups, etc.)

ðŸ§­ mvwchgat(win, y, x, ...)
  - Moves cursor to (y, x) within a specific window
  - Applies changes from there


Highlighting a section of text:
```c
mvprintw(0, 0, "This is a test line.");
mvchgat(0, 10, 4, A_REVERSE, 1, NULL); // highlights "test"
```

Using it in a custom window:
```c
WINDOW *win = newwin(10, 30, 5, 5);
mvwprintw(win, 1, 2, "Item 1   Item 2   Item 3");
mvwchgat(win, 1, 2, 6, A_STANDOUT, 2, NULL); // highlights "Item 1"
```

Gotchas:
- These functions donâ€™t change whatâ€™s written, only how it looks.
- If you overwrite the text afterward, the attributes are lost unless reapplied.
- You must call `refresh()` (or `wrefresh()`) afterward to actually see the effect.

### Chapter 14: `clrtoeol` / `clrtobot` + `erase()` / `refresh()`

The two terminal janitors:
  - `clrtoeol()` cleans from the cursor to the end of the current line.
  - `clrtobot()` wipes everything from the cursor down to the bottom of the window, including the current line.

---

`erase()` and `clear()` may seem similar on the surface, but underneath, they are a little bit different.

`erase()` : Clears the window's contents in memory, but does not force an immediate redraw of the screen.
  - Works silently with your next `refresh()` or `wrefresh()`.
  - Ideal for partial updates, flickerless redraws.

```c
erase();       // marks the stdscr for clearing
refresh();     // now it actually shows the cleared screen
```

`clear()` : Same as `erase()`, but also tells curses to clear the physical screen completely on the next `refresh()`.
  - The terminal acts as if it was just launched.
  - Can cause flickering
  - Good for a fresh, guaranteed blank state.

```c
clear();       // like erase() + "I said CLEAR DAMN IT"
refresh();
```

--- 

```c
#include <ncurses.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  initscr();
  noecho();
  refresh();

  printw("Hello");
  mvprintw(1, 0, "PwatPwat");
  move(0, 1);
  getch();
  // clear routines
  // to the end of line
  clrtoeol();
  getch();

  mvprintw(2, 0, "To clean");
  mvprintw(3, 0, "To clean");
  mvprintw(5, 0, "To clean");
  mvprintw(10, 0, "To clean");
  move(2, 5);
  getch();

  // to the bottom
  clrtobot();
  getch();

  // erase(); soft clear
  // clear(); definitely clear

  getch();
  endwin();
  return 0;
}
```

### Chapter 15: `leaveok` / `immedok` / `scrollok`

#### `leaveok(win, TRUE)`
- Don't care where the cursor is, just leave it wherever.
- Prevents `ncurses` from moving the hardware cursor.
- Skips cursor repositioning.
- It's fast.

#### `immedok(win, TRUE)`
- Every time I change the window, update it immediately.
- Forces `wrefresh(win)` automatically after every `waddch()`, `mvwprintw()`, etc.
- Slower, but more dynamic and automatic.

#### `scrollok(win, TRUE)`
- If we hit the bottom, just scroll the window down.
- Enables automatic scrolling when adding text past the bottom line.
- Useful for chat logs, terminal output windows, logs, etc.
- Requires enough space (and usually `idlok()` too for smooth scrolling).

--- 

```c
#include <ncurses.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  initscr();
  noecho();
  refresh();

  WINDOW *win = newwin(5, 8, 10, 10);
  box(win, 0, 0);

  /* 
  // don't really need to know where the cursor is
  leaveok(win, true);
  wmove(win, 1, 2);
  wgetch(win);
  */

  /* 
  // refresh immediately
  immedok(win, true);
  waddch(win, 'a');
  */

  /* 
  // allow continuous scrolling
  scrollok(win, true);
  int counter = 0;
  while (true) {
    chtype ch = (counter % 10) + '0';
    waddch(win, ch);
    wrefresh(win);
    counter++;
  }
  */

  // clearok(WINDOW *, bool)

  getch();
  endwin();
  return 0;
}
```

### Chapter 16: Background Routines (`bkgdset` / `bkgd` / `wbkgdset` / `wbkgd`)

Those are routines to manipulate the background of a named window.

```c
// Background routines
#include <ncurses.h>

int main() {
  initscr();
  refresh();
  clear();

  if (!has_colors()) {
    return 1;
  }
  start_color();
  init_pair(1, COLOR_BLACK, COLOR_RED);
  init_pair(2, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLUE);

  // setting attributes for the future
  bkgdset(COLOR_PAIR(1));
  addch('a');
  refresh();

  /*
  bkgd('a'); fill the background
  addch('u');
  */

  /*
  // bkgd vs wbkgd
  bkgd(COLOR_PAIR(1));
  refresh();
  */

  WINDOW *win = newwin(10, 25, 10, 10);

  wbkgdset(win, COLOR_PAIR(2));
  wclear(win);
  wrefresh(win);

  /*
  wbkgd(win, COLOR_PAIR(2));
  box(win, 0, 0);
  wrefresh(win);
  */

  getch();
  endwin();
  return 0;
}
```

### Chapter 17 Free Window memory with `delwin()`: 

- `newwin()` allocates memory for a WINDOW structure.
- `delwin()` deallocates that memory, it's like `free()` for windows.

ðŸ§¼ When to use delwin():

âœ… Use it:
- When a window is no longer needed (e.g., after closing a dialog box).
- After calling wclear() and wrefresh() to visually wipe it off the screen.
- In well-structured code where windows are dynamically created and destroyed.

ðŸš« You can skip it:
- In small toy programs or examples where the window is static and only created once.
- If the program ends right after and the OS will clean up anyway (but that's lazy energy).

```c
// Deleting Window Memory
// Increase security with delwin()

#include <curses.h>
#include <ncurses.h>

int main() {
  initscr();

  WINDOW *test_win = newwin(10, 25, 0, 0);
  box(test_win, 0, 0);
  refresh();
  wrefresh(test_win);

  getch();

  wclear(test_win);
  wrefresh(test_win);
  // ensure all associated memory for WINDOW is deleted
  // but, does not erase the visual portion on its own.
  // Use wclear(win) and wrefresh(win) first to do so.
  delwin(test_win);

  refresh();
  // wrefresh(test_win); // referencing it after it's been deleted can cause a
  // segfault
  getch();

  endwin();
  return 0;
}
```
