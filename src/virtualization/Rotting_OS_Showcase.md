# Showcase of a Rotting Operating System Inside of a Dying One
_Exploring cursed and forgotten operating systems in VirtualBox on Windows 10._

## Introduction
An exploration of obscure, unstable, or otherwise obsolete operating systems that were either born too early, too cursed, or simply betrayed by capitalism. All tested inside VirtualBox, nested within Windows 10 like a digital sarcophagus.

Each entry includes:
- Boot Ritual (install + config steps)
- First Impressions (UI, vibes, CPU fan behavior)
- Haunted Features (quirks and bugs)
- Cause of Death (why it disappeared)
- Survival Chances (0.5 to 5 rating on worthiness of keeping the ISO nearby)

### Boot Ritual
- Boots instantly. ISO smaller than your average meme.

### First Impressions
- Everything is bright, fast, and written by a prophet.

- Talking to God in real-time. CMD interface that requires spiritual commitment.

### Cause of Death
- A lone genius with a tragic tale.

---

## ⭐ Windows 98 SE (Survival: 4.5/5)
### Boot Ritual
- Install drivers or perish. Works better with VirtualBox additions.

---

## ⭐ Windows ME (Survival: 2.5/5)
### Boot Ritual
- Somehow harder to install than Windows 98.

### First Impressions
- Chaotic UI, weird bugs, haunting silence.

---

## ⭐ BeOS / Haiku (Survival: 4/5)
### Boot Ritual
- Haiku boots fast. BeOS needs a rare ISO and ancient setup magic.

### First Impressions
- Surprisingly elegant. Multi-threaded queen.

### Haunted Features
- Tabs, workspaces, and multimedia focus.

### Cause of Death
- Be Inc. sabotaged and bought out. Haiku carries the torch.

---

## ⭐ KolibriOS (Survival: 3.5/5)

- Assembly-coded GUI, but hard to navigate.

### Cause of Death
- Stuck in its own lane, eternally.

---

## ⭐ QNX Demo Disk (Survival: 4/5)
### Boot Ritual
- One floppy. One dream.

### First Impressions
- Real-time OS that feels slicker than early Linux.

### Haunted Features
- Full GUI and web browser from a single disk.

### Cause of Death
- QNX lives on in embedded, but this version? A forgotten gem.

---

## ⭐ OS/2 Warp (Survival: 2.5/5)
### Boot Ritual
- IBM installer vibes, with confusing partitioning.

### First Impressions
- Looks like 1995 corporate purgatory.
