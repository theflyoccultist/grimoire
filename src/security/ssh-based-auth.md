🔐 TinyAuth-SSH — SSH-Based Auth System for Personal Tools
💡 Concept:

No passwords, no tokens, just straight-up SSH public key authentication for accessing private dashboards or API routes. You're not logging in, you're declaring war on unauthorized access.
📦 How It Works (High-Level Flow):

    User Registration:

        User submits their public SSH key via an invite-only route or direct DB insert.

        Store the key in your database (authorized_keys style).

    Login Flow:

        Client uses their private key to sign a challenge string (nonce from the server).

        Server verifies the signature using stored public key.

        On success, it grants a session cookie or temporary token (if needed for HTMX or UI).

    Session or Stateless Access:

        You can use Flask or FastAPI to maintain a session after authentication.

        Or keep it stateless and re-auth every time for tighter control.

    Admin Interface (HTMX powered):

        Add/remove SSH keys.

        See login history.

        Per-project access controls.

🔧 Tech Stack for This:

    Python:

        cryptography or paramiko for SSH key handling & signature verification

    FastAPI (or Flask):

        API endpoints: /login, /verify, /logout

        Optional: Admin dashboard with HTMX

    SQLite or Postgres:

        Table with: user_id, ssh_public_key, project_access, last_login

💥 Bonus Points for Ultimate Girlboss Flex:

    Add a command-line script (authme) that auto-logs you into the app via signed key.

    Integrate SSH key handling into your grimoire.

    Make login attempts log to Prometheus and display weird alerts like “Unauthorized presence detected… 🐍”
