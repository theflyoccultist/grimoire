## The Grimoire: Tome of Cursed Knowledge

This is the place where I collect all the knowledge earned during my self taught computer science journey, a grimoire that freely, available to be consulted at any time.

Rather than leaving my notes scattered across random bookmarks, Discord servers, notebooks and Google Docs, this grimoire serves as a **single source of truth** for all the things that I'm learning during in this tedious, painful path.

If you're reading this, you're either **past-me, future-me, or an unfortunate soul who has stumbled upon my secret knowledge.** Either way, remember:

- 🛠️ Debugging is an art, not a science.

- 💀 Despite accumulating knowledge, there will still always be a moment where you'll be thrown into the unknown, left to figure it out. That's just how things are.
